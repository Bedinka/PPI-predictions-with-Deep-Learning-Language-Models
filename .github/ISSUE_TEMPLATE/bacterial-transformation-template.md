- [ ] 1. Book bacterial culture room (room 219)
- [ ] 2. Thaw competent cells on ice.
- [ ] 3. Chill approximately 1 ng (2 μl) of the ligation mixture in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
- [ ] 4. Add 20 µl of competent cells to the DNA. Mix gently by pipetting up and down or flicking the tube 4–5 times to mix the cells and DNA. Do not vortex.
- [ ] 5. Place the mixture on ice for 30 minutes. Do not mix.
- [ ] 6. Heat shock at 42°C for 30 seconds*. Do not mix.
- [ ] 7. Add 500 µl of room temperature media* to the tube.
- [ ] 8. Place tube at 37°C for 60 minutes. Shake vigorously (250 rpm) or rotate. * For Amp, this step can be skipped.
- [ ] 9. Warm selection plates to 37°C. (room temperature is fine)
- [ ] 10. Spread 100 - 200 µl of the cells and ligation mixture onto the plates.
- [ ] 11. Incubate overnight at 37°C.

* Please note: For the duration and temperature of the heat shock step as well as for the media to be used during the recovery period, please follow the recommendations provided by the competent cells’ manufacturer.

If we have colony, then make glycerol stock and miniprep
- [ ] Book the flowhood for bacteria
- [ ] Use the LB with Amp + Cm 5mL culture

And make the following media.

- [ ] overnight culture

- [ ] glycerol preservation (500uL cell culture + 500uL 50% glycerol)
- [ ] miniprep
