* Collect Cells
- [ ] Harvest the bacterial culture by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 2min or 4000 rpm for 10min
- [ ] Removing all supernatant

* Resuspend Cells, Lyse and Neutralize

- [ ] Resuspend Cells with 250uL Resuspension Solution and vortex
- [ ] Add 250uL Lysis Solution and invert the tube 4-6 times (Lysis Solution is in 4C)
- [ ] Add 350uL Neutralization Solution and invert the tube 4-6 times
- [ ] Centrifuge 5 min with 12000 rpm

* Bind DNA

- [ ] Transfer the supernatant to the Spin Column
- [ ] Centrifuge 1 min with 12000 rpm (==> several samples can be combined into 1 column)

* Wash the column

- [ ] Add 500uL of Wash Solution
- [ ] Centrifuge 1 min with 12000 rpm
- [ ] Discard the flow-through
- [ ] Add 500uL of Wash Solution
- [ ] Centrifuge 1 min with 12000 rpm
- [ ] Discard the flow-through

- [ ] Centrifuge 1 min with 12000 rpm
- [ ] Discard the flow-through

* Elute purified DNA
- [ ] Transfer the column into a new tube
- [ ] Add 50uL of Elution Buffer to column (100uL when merge multiple samples into 1 column)
- [ ] Incubate at least 2 minute (it is important)
- [ ] Centrifuge 2 min with 12000 rpm
- [ ] Collect the flow-through
